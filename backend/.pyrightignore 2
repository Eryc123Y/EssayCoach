# Pyright ignore rules for EssayCoach
# Exclude test files and migrations from strict type checking

# Test files - Django/DRF test client types are not fully stubbed
**/tests/**/*.py
**/test_*.py

# Database migrations - autogenerated code
**/migrations/**/*.py
**/migrations/*.py

# Django admin stubs - known limitations
**/admin.py

# Third-party library type stubs that are incomplete
# These will be handled by the pyproject.toml configuration
